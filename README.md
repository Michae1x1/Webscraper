# Webscraper

The purpose of this assignment was to create a 'flexible' webscraper that could pull data from an infinite scroll webpage; namely, Steam's top seller page. Data pulled from the webpage was also analyzed to view differences of discounted pricing/regular pricing as well as to see which games were selling the most.
